<h2>About</h2>
<p> 
Expert in the planning, development, and scalability of multi-platform applications with Flutter, and a member of the Flutter organization on Github. Currently, I play a crucial role as Mobile Release Manager at MGM Resorts, being key in achieving a reduction in the update interval from 4 to 2 weeks, which has allowed a faster delivery of valuable features and corrections to more than 2 million users.

I led the mobile development of Belo, an Argentine cryptocurrency wallet, reaching 200,000 users and raising 3 million dollars in investments during the first 9 months.

I am also the creator of StartFit, a fitness application that facilitates the connection between sports professionals and athletes, adding more than 25,000 users worldwide.
