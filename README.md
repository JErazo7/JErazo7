<h2>About</h2>
<p> 
As a Flutter and Firebase Expert, Mobile Team Lead at MGM Resorts, I've carved a significant path in the mobile development and management landscape. My expertise spans not only high-level technical execution but also visionary leadership in transformative and impactful digital experiences for millions.

At MGM Resorts, my role as a Lead Mobile Release Manager has been pivotal. I managed to cut the update cycle in half, from four to two weeks, optimizing new feature delivery and issue resolution for an audience of over 4 million users. This achievement reflects my technical prowess, operational excellence commitment, and user satisfaction focus.

My leadership was instrumental in the mobile development of Belo, an Argentine cryptocurrency wallet that redefines access to the digital economy. As the head of the mobile project, I drove the platform towards exponential growth, securing 200,000 users and $3 million in investments within just 9 months. This accomplishment underscores my ability to lead with a forward-thinking vision, driving both technological innovation and business growth.

I founded and developed StartFit, a fitness app that bridges the gap between sports professionals and athletes, cultivating an active community of over 25,000 users worldwide. This project is a testament to my passion for developing digital solutions that connect and empower people while fostering positive social impact.

My focus has always been on leveraging technology to address real challenges, with a constant drive to explore new opportunities and apply disruptive innovations in the mobile app domain. I'm continually seeking projects that not only challenge my technical skills but also offer the chance to make a significant difference in people's lives.
