<h2>About</h2>
<p> 
Expert in multi-platform application development with Flutter. I have experience and the skills required to develop ideas, scale them and turn them into successful products or services.

I have collaborated with multi-million dollar companies with thousands of active users per day such as MGM Resorts and Team INC, playing a key role in making decisions about the implementation and architectural improvements based on the scalability of mobile applications developed with Flutter.

In the startup ecosystem, I have led the development of mobile applications such as Belo, an Argentine Crypto Wallet, which in its first 9 months of operation reached 200,000 users and raised an investment round of 3 million dollars.

I am also the creator of StartFit, a Fitness App that connects fitness professionals with athletes and currently has 25 thousand users and more than 200 subscriptions sold around the world.
